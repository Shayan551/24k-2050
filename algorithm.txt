OBJECTIVE 3

TASK 1

PROBLEM
Q. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a
divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1. Ask the user to input a number (x) (divisor)
2. Ask the user to input another number (y) (dividend)
3. Check if y MOD x = 0
4. if no then , Display “the number is not divisible”
5. if yes then , do y MOD 2 , if it’s = 0 then it’s even otherwise it’s odd
6. Display “the number is divisible and even / odd

TASK 3

PROBLEM
Q. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%).
1. Ask the user to input number (N1)
2. Ask the user to input another number (N2)

3. Ask the user to input a operator (+ ,- ,* ,/ ,%)
4. Perform the operation entered by the user (+ - * / % ) between N1 and N2
5. Set Result = N1 (+,-,*,/,%) N2
6. Display Result
